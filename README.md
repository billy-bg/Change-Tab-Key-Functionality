# Change Tab Key Functionality Obsidian Plugin

A simple plugin that changes the tab key functionality in Obsidian from indenting the current line/paragraph (default) to moving the cursor to the end of the line (command+right arrow; new functionality). This is useful when using templates and html tags in your documents. This plugin is designed to work with the [Templater Fix Plugin](https://github.com/billy-bg/Templater-Fix-Plugin). For example, you can insert a template to highlight your given text green (`<span style="background:#00FF00A8">example text</span>`), with the Templater Fix Plugin, your cursor will automatically be placed in the middle of both tags, you can then write your desired text and use the tab key to move the cursor to the end of the line and quickly continue writing without disrupting your workflow.

This plugin is also designed to continue to allow other plugins to use the tab key for their own functionality. For example, the Latex Suite Plugin will still allow you to use the tab key to navigate between latex commands in math regions and to expand non-auto snippets outside of math regions.

# Instructions:

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. I hope this plugin helps you out!
